# ghost-shell

My experiments of creating a simple working shell while studying some operating systems subjects. Not intended for production use.

### Features

- **pipe**: Support chaining processes with pipes;

### TODO

Some features I would like to implement if I manage to have some time.

- IO redirection;
- Enhanced input (auto-completion, cursor navigation);
- Background execution;
